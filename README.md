# sdimager
This tool is used for writing drive images to USB sticks or SD cards

Writes and reads complete drive images to/from SD drives. 

Running on Windows 7 and above, requires .NET Framework 4.5

Because Win32DiskImager didn't work on my computers (Win7 + Win8), I decided to write my own tool using VS2013 and .Net 4.5. 

Currently it can read and write Images from/to SD drives or other via USB attached storage. Basic formatting functionality is also included.
